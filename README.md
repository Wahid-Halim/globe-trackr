# Worldwise

Worldwise is an interactive web application built with **React.js** that allows users to explore geographical data and maps in an engaging and user-friendly way. The project leverages **React Router** for smooth client-side navigation, **Leaflet** library for powerful and customizable map visualizations, and **CSS Modules** for scoped and maintainable styling.

## Features

- Interactive maps powered by Leaflet
- Multiple routes and pages using React Router
- Clean, modular styling with CSS Modules
- Dynamic data fetching and display

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you need to set up a fake JSON server that will serve as the backend API for the application.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Install the fake JSON server globally (if not already installed):

```bash
npm install -g json-server
